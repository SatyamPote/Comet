## üåê API Integration

This project uses the YouTube Data API v3 to search and retrieve video information.

### Example API Request
When you perform a search, the app sends a GET request to the YouTube API like this:
```
GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search
```

### Parameters Used
- **q**: The search query entered by the user.
- **part**: Specifies the video information to retrieve (e.g., snippet).
- **maxResults**: Number of results to return (default: 10).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Autoplay Restrictions
Some browsers might block autoplay functionality due to user interaction requirements.

### API Rate Limiting
The app depends on the YouTube Data API, which enforces request quotas. Heavy usage might exceed the quota.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Add Playlists**: Allow users to save and organize favorite videos in custom playlists.
2. **User Authentication**: Use OAuth to personalize user experiences with accounts.
